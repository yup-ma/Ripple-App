        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-update">Last updated April 2nd, 2022</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>We&rsquo;ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) so you&rsquo;ll know
                the rules that govern our relationship with you as a user of our Services. Although we have tried our
                best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where they may still read like a traditional
                contract. There&rsquo;s a good reason for that: these Terms form a legally binding contract between you
                and Ripple Interactive, Inc. (&ldquo;Ripple&rdquo;). So please read them carefully.</p>
            <p>By using Ripple which is subject to these Terms (which we refer to collectively as the
                &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t agree with them, then
                don&rsquo;t use the Services.</p>
            <p>ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES
                OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND RIPPLE AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE
                RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND Ripple WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A
                CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AS
                EXPLAINED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong> Who Can Use the Services</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>No one who is not a college student, or recent college student is allowed to create an account or use the
                Services. If you are under 18, you may only use the Services with the prior consent of your parent or
                legal guardian. Please be sure your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with
                you before you start using the Services. We may offer additional Services with additional terms that may
                require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully. By using the Services, you
                represent, warrant, and agree that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you can form a binding contract with Ripple;</li>
                <li>you are not a person who is barred from using the Services under the laws of the United States or
                    any other applicable jurisdiction&mdash;including, for example, that you do not appear on the U.S.
                    Treasury Department&rsquo;s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar
                    prohibition;</li>
                <li>you are not a convicted sex offender; and</li>
                <li>you will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws,
                    rules, and regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you represent that you are
                authorized to bind that business or entity to these Terms and you agree to these Terms on behalf of that
                business or entity (and all references to &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; in these Terms will
                mean both you as the end user and that business or entity).</p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li><strong> Rights We Grant You</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>As between you and us, Ripple (and its licensors) is the owner of the Services, including all proprietary
                content, information, material, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents,
                trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, video, music, and &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo;
                of the Services, and all related intellectual property rights. Ripple grants you a worldwide,
                royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to use the
                Services. This license is for the sole purpose of using and enjoying the Services in a way that these
                Terms and our policies, such as our Community Guidelines allow. You may not use the Services in ways
                that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.</p>
            <ol start="3">
                <li><strong> Rights You Grant Us</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Many of our Services let you upload, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain
                whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that
                content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.
            </p>
            <p>For all content you submit to the Services, you grant Ripple and our affiliates a worldwide,
                royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce,
                modify, adapt, edit, publish, analyze, transmit, and distribute that content. This license is for the
                purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and
                developing new ones. This license includes a right for us to make your content available to, and pass
                these rights along to, service providers with whom we have contractual relationships related to the
                provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing such Services.</p>
            <p>While we&rsquo;re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any
                time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content
                violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post,
                send, or store through the Service.</p>
            <p>We, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services, including
                personalized advertising based on the information you provide us, we collect, or we obtain about you.
                Advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your content.</p>
            <p>We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can
                use them without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you. You agree that we
                will own all rights in any materials or items we develop based on such feedback or suggestions.</p>
            <ol start="4">
                <li><strong> Additional Terms for Specific Services</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Additional terms and conditions listed on the Ripple Terms &amp; Policies page or that are otherwise made
                available to you may apply to specific Services. If you use those Services, then those additional terms
                become part of these Terms. If any of the applicable additional terms conflict with these Terms, the
                additional terms will prevail while you are using the Services to which they apply.</p>
            <ol start="5">
                <li><strong> Privacy</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how your information is handled when you use our Services by
                reading our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <ol start="6">
                <li><strong> The Content of Others</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether
                that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the user or
                entity that submitted it. Although Ripple reserves the right to review or remove all content that
                appears on the Services, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot&mdash;and do
                not&mdash;guarantee that other users or the content they provide through the Services will comply with
                our Terms or Community Guidelines.</p>
            <ol start="7">
                <li><strong> Respecting the Services and Ripple&rsquo;s Rights</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>You must also respect Ripple&rsquo;s rights and adhere to the Ripple Brand Guidelines, and any other
                guidelines, support pages, or FAQ&rsquo;s published by Ripple or our affiliates. That means, among other
                things, you may not do, attempt to do, enable, or encourage anyone else to do, any of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>use branding, logos, icons, user interface elements, designs, photographs, videos, or any other
                    materials Ripple makes available via the Services, except as explicitly allowed by these Terms, the
                    Ripple Brand Guidelines, or other brand guidelines published by Ripple or our affiliates;</li>
                <li>violate or infringe Ripple&rsquo;s or our affiliates&rsquo; copyrights, trademarks, or other
                    intellectual property rights;</li>
                <li>copy, modify, archive, download, upload, disclose, distribute, sell, lease, syndicate, broadcast,
                    perform, display, make available, make derivatives of, or otherwise use the Services or the content
                    on the Services, other than temporary files that are automatically cached by your web browser for
                    display purposes, as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, as otherwise expressly permitted
                    by us in writing, or as enabled by the Service&rsquo;s intended functionality;</li>
                <li>create more than one account for yourself, create another account if we have already disabled your
                    account, attempt to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications, solicit login
                    credentials from other users, or buy, sell, rent, or lease access to your account, a username,
                    Ripples, or a friend link;</li>
                <li>reverse engineer, duplicate, decompile, disassemble, or decode the Services (including any
                    underlying idea or algorithm), or otherwise extract the source code of the software of the Service;
                </li>
                <li>use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the
                    Services or extract other users&rsquo; information;</li>
                <li>use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users&rsquo;
                    content or information without our written consent;</li>
                <li>use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other
                    users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the
                    functioning of the Services;</li>
                <li>upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise, bypass, or circumvent the security
                    of the Services;</li>
                <li>attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or
                    features of the Services that you are not authorized to access;</li>
                <li>probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network;</li>
                <li>violate any applicable law or regulation in connection with your access to or use of the Services;
                    or</li>
                <li>access or use the Services in any way not expressly permitted by these Terms or our Community
                    Guidelines.&nbsp;</li>

            <ol start="8">
                <li><strong> Respecting Others' Rights</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Ripple respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not use the Services, or
                enable anyone else to use the Services, in a manner that violates or infringes someone else&rsquo;s
                rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right. When you
                submit content to the Service, you agree and represent that you own that content, or that you have
                received all necessary permissions, clearances, and authorizations in order to submit it to the Service
                (including, if applicable, the right to make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in
                any sound recordings, synchronize any compositions to any content, publicly perform any compositions or
                sound recordings, or any other applicable rights for any music not provided by Ripple that you include
                in your content) and grant the rights and licenses contained in these Terms for your content. You also
                agree that you will not use or attempt to use another user&rsquo;s account except as permitted by Ripple
                or its affiliates.</p>
            <p>Ripple honors copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and takes reasonable steps
                to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. If Ripple
                becomes aware that a user has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our
                power to terminate the user&rsquo;s account. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a
                copyright that you own or control, please report it by contacting us. Or you may file a notice with our
                designated agent: Ripple Inc., Attn: Copyright Agent, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, email:
                copyright @ Rippleapp.com. Don&rsquo;t use this email address for anything other than reporting
                copyright infringement, as such emails will be ignored. To report other forms of infringement on the
                Services, please use the tool accessible here. If you file a notice with our Copyright Agent, it must
                comply with the requirements set forth at <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">17
                    U.S.C. &sect; 512(c)(3)</a>. That means the notice must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the
                    copyright owner;</li>
                <li>identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;</li>
                <li>identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity
                    and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably
                    sufficient to let us locate the material;</li>
                <li>provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;
                </li>
                <li>provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the
                    manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
                <li>provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of
                    perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol start="9">
                <li><strong> Safety</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we can&rsquo;t guarantee it.
                That&rsquo;s where you come in. By using the Services, you agree that you will at all times comply with
                these Terms, including our Community Guidelines and any other policies Ripple makes available in order
                to maintain the safety of the Services.</p>
            <p>If you fail to comply, we reserve the right to remove any offending content, terminate or limit the
                visibility of your account, and notify third parties&mdash;including law enforcement&mdash;and provide
                those third parties with information relating to your account. This step may be necessary to protect the
                safety of our users, and others, to investigate, remedy, and enforce potential Terms violations, and to
                detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</p>
            <p>We also care about your physical safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way
                that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never use the Services while
                driving. And never put yourself or others in harm&rsquo;s way just to capture a Ripple.</p>
            <ol start="10">
                <li><strong> Your Account</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>To use certain Services, you need to create an account. You agree to provide us with accurate, complete,
                and updated information for your account. You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your
                account. So it&rsquo;s important that you keep your account secure. One way to do that is to select a
                strong password that you don&rsquo;t use for any other account. If you think that someone has gained
                access to your account, please immediately reach out to <a
                    href="https://rippleapp.com/contact/">Support</a>. Any software that we provide you may
                automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust
                these automatic downloads through your device&rsquo;s settings. You agree not to create any account if
                we have previously removed or banned you or your account from any of our Services, unless we consent
                otherwise.</p>

                <li><strong> Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THAT YOU AND Ripple AGREE TO RESOLVE
                ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In this Section 18 (the &ldquo;Arbitration
                    Agreement&rdquo;), You and Ripple agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or
                    otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms
                    or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding
                    arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Ripple are not required to arbitrate any
                    dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights,
                    trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: the phrase &ldquo;all claims
                    and disputes&rdquo; also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective
                    date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including
                    disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the
                    Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.</li>
                <li>Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the
                    interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision, and not state law. Arbitration
                    will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (&ldquo;ADR Services&rdquo;) (https://www.adrservices.com/).
                    If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral
                    forum, and if they cannot agree, will ask the court to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C.
                    &sect; 5. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the
                    extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral
                    arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be
                    resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking
                    relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a
                    hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered
                    by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
                <li>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the
                    arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the
                    three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration
                    will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually
                    agree otherwise.</li>
                <li>Fees. ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are available at
                    https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/. If Ripple is the party initiating an arbitration
                    against you, Ripple will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing
                    fee. If you are the party initiating an arbitration against Ripple, you will be responsible for the
                    first $100 toward the nonrefundable Initial Filing Fee, and Ripple will pay the remainder of your
                    Initial Filing fee and both parties&rsquo; Administrative Fee.</li>
                <li>Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the
                    rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Ripple. The dispute will not be consolidated with any
                    other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to
                    grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the
                    authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
                    individual under law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a
                    written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which
                    the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
                    authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The
                    award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Ripple.</li>
                <li>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND Ripple WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT
                    AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Ripple are instead electing to have claims
                    and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
                    efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by
                    a court. In any litigation between you and Ripple over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration
                    award, YOU AND Ripple WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be
                    resolved by a judge.</li>
                <li>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS
                    ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS
                    BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR
                    CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
                    Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services&rsquo; Rules, disputes regarding the
                    interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and
                    not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or
                    unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will
                    be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.</li>
                <li>Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by
                    the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion
                    of this Arbitration Agreement.</li>
                <li>Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Ripple can
                    force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Ripple in writing no later than 30 days
                    after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and
                    address, your Ripple username and the email address you used to set up your Ripple account (if you
                    have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You
                    must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Ripple Interactive Inc., email the opt-out
                    notice to arbitration-opt-out@Rippleapp.com.</li>
                <li>Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Ripple may bring an individual
                    action in small claims court.</li>
                <li>Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your
                    relationship with Ripple.</li>
                <li><strong> Exclusive Venue</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>To the extent that these Terms allow you or Ripple to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Ripple
                agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory claims
                and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated
                exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however,
                that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and disputes will
                be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and Ripple
                consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.</p>
            <ol start="19">
                <li><strong> Choice of Law</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its
                conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or
                otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter.</p>
            <ol start="20">
                <li><strong> Severability</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these
                Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
            <ol start="21">
                <li><strong> California Residents</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1789.3, you may report
                complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California

            </ol>
            <p>These Terms, including the additional terms referenced in Section 4, make up the entire agreement between
                you and Ripple, and supersede any prior agreements. These Terms do not create or confer any third-party
                beneficiary rights. If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.
                We reserve the right to transfer our rights under these Terms and provide the Services using another
                entity, provided that entity upholds these Terms. You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations
